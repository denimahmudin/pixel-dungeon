Pixel Dungeon ITA
==================

Italian translation of the "traditional roguelike game with pixel-art graphics and simple interface".

This is the first time we release this translation of Pixel Dungeon. Also, it hasn't been tested enough so any opinion is accepted.

This repo is a fork of Pixel Dungeon
